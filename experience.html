<td colspan="2"><br><br><center>Since the age of 14, I became active in bowling. It started with wanting to try holding a bowling ball until I was able to represent the school and the district. In high school I attended a bowling club. Since then, I have become more active in bowling and the bowling club teachers are aware of my talent and have told me to follow the selection of school representatives for bowling. I started representing the school for bowling at the age of 15 and managed to represent the district after getting third place at the school level. The picture above is when I represented the Perak Tengah district school in 2017 when I was 17 years old. At the district level, I got second place and at the state level I got third place in the group.</center></td>

<td colspan="2"><br><br><center>When I was a semester 2 student in 2019, I participated in a mural painting program at Rumah Seri Kenangan, Bedong. The program lasted for two days. On the first day, we came to clean the area around the house. On the second day, we painted murals and played games such as congkak, chess and more with the occupants of the house. This program provides many valuable lessons and experiences for me to remember. Apart from being able to socialize with the residents of the house, I can also do this volunteer program with friends where this is an experience that always remains in the memory.</center></td>
